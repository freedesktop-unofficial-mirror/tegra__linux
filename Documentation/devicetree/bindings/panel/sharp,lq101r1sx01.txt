Sharp Microelectronics 10.1" WQXGA TFT LCD panel

This panel requires dual-channel DSI to operate. It supports two modes:
- left-right: the two channels drive the left or right halves of the screen
- odd-even: the two channels drive the odd or even lines of the screen

Each of the DSI channels drives a separate DSI peripheral. The left (or odd)
peripheral is considered the primary peripheral and controls the device. The
phandle to the right (or even) peripheral is specified in a property called
"secondary".

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sharp,lq101r1sx01"
- secondary: phandle of the DSI peripheral that is the second link
- power-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage

Optional properties:
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
